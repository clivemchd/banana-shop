# Video Loading with Poster Images Implementation

## Overview
Enhanced the `VideoPlayer` component to display poster images while videos are loading, providing a better user experience on the landing page.

## Implementation Details

### Key Changes

#### 1. **VideoPlayer Component** (`/src/client/core/video-manager/video-player.tsx`)

**New Features:**
- ✅ Automatic poster image detection (replaces `.mp4` with `.png` and `/videos/` with `/images/`)
- ✅ Optional custom poster image via `posterImage` prop
- ✅ Smooth transition from poster to video
- ✅ Video only shows when it starts playing (not just loaded)
- ✅ Maintains all existing responsive positioning and styling

**New State:**
```typescript
const [isVideoLoaded, setIsVideoLoaded] = useState(false);      // Video can play through
const [isVideoPlaying, setIsVideoPlaying] = useState(false);     // Video is actively playing
```

**New Event Listeners:**
- `canplaythrough`: Detects when video is fully loaded
- `playing`: Detects when video starts playing

**Render Logic:**
1. Poster image is displayed by default
2. Video element is loaded in background (opacity-0, absolute positioning)
3. When video starts playing, poster is hidden and video becomes visible
4. Both elements maintain the same className and style for consistent sizing

### 2. **Poster Image Naming Convention**

Videos and their corresponding poster images must follow this pattern:
```
/assets/videos/hero-snippet.mp4           → /assets/images/hero-snippet.png
/assets/videos/feature-create-snippet.mp4 → /assets/images/feature-create-snippet.png
/assets/videos/feature-edit-snippet.mp4   → /assets/images/feature-edit-snippet.png
/assets/videos/feature-history-snippet.mp4 → /assets/images/feature-history-snippet.png
```

### 3. **Current Usage**

**Hero Section** (`hero.tsx`):
- Video: `/assets/videos/hero-snippet.mp4`
- Auto-detected poster: `/assets/images/hero-snippet.png`

**Features Section** (`features.tsx`):
- 3 feature videos with auto-detected posters
- All use the same className and responsive positioning

## Benefits

### User Experience
- ✅ **Instant visual feedback** - No blank space while videos load
- ✅ **Smooth transitions** - Seamless switch from poster to video
- ✅ **Consistent sizing** - Poster and video share the same dimensions
- ✅ **Better perceived performance** - Page appears fully loaded immediately

### Technical
- ✅ **Backward compatible** - Works with existing video configurations
- ✅ **Minimal code changes** - Only modified VideoPlayer component
- ✅ **Automatic detection** - No manual poster path configuration needed
- ✅ **Flexible** - Supports custom poster images if needed

## How It Works

### Loading Sequence
```
1. Component mounts
   ↓
2. Poster image displays immediately (same size/position as video)
   ↓
3. Video loads in background (hidden with opacity-0)
   ↓
4. Video fires 'canplaythrough' event → isVideoLoaded = true
   ↓
5. Video fires 'playing' event → isVideoPlaying = true
   ↓
6. Poster hidden, video becomes visible
```

### Image Sizing
Both poster and video use:
- Same `className` prop (e.g., `"object-cover w-full h-full scale-125"`)
- Same `style` prop (for responsive positioning)
- Same container dimensions

This ensures **pixel-perfect** sizing consistency.

## Custom Poster Images

If you need to use a different poster image:

```typescript
<VideoPlayer 
  settings={{
    src: "/assets/videos/my-video.mp4",
    posterImage: "/assets/images/custom-poster.png", // Custom path
    // ... other settings
  }}
/>
```

## Testing Checklist

- [x] Poster images display immediately on page load
- [x] Videos play automatically after loading (autoPlay enabled)
- [x] Smooth transition from poster to video
- [x] No layout shift between poster and video
- [x] Works on all breakpoints (responsive positioning maintained)
- [x] No TypeScript errors
- [x] All 4 videos on landing page (hero + 3 features) work correctly

## File Modifications

1. **Modified:** `/src/client/core/video-manager/video-player.tsx`
   - Added `posterImage` to `VideoSettings` interface
   - Added loading state management
   - Enhanced render logic with poster image support

## Assets Required

Ensure these poster images exist:
```
/public/assets/images/
  ├── hero-snippet.png
  ├── feature-create-snippet.png
  ├── feature-edit-snippet.png
  └── feature-history-snippet.png
```

## Performance Impact

**Positive:**
- Faster perceived load time
- Better user experience on slow connections
- Reduced layout shifts

**Negligible:**
- Minimal additional code (~40 lines)
- Images are lightweight compared to videos
- No performance degradation

## Browser Compatibility

Works with all modern browsers that support:
- HTML5 `<video>` element
- React hooks (`useState`, `useEffect`, `useRef`)
- CSS `object-fit` and `object-position`

## Future Enhancements

Possible improvements:
1. Add loading spinner overlay
2. Support for WebP poster images
3. Lazy loading for videos below fold
4. Preload hints for faster video loading
5. Error handling for missing poster images
