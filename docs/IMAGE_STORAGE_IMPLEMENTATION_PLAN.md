# Image Storage & Edit History Implementation Plan

## Overview
Implementation of robust image storage system with presigned URLs, edit history, and persistent user data for the dashboard image editing functionality.

## Problem Statement
- Current implementation sends large base64 images causing 413 (Payload Too Large) errors
- Images are lost on browser refresh
- No edit history or version control
- Poor user experience with lost work

## Solution Architecture
Replace direct base64 uploads with GCS presigned URLs and comprehensive database storage.

## Phase 1: Database Schema Implementation âœ… COMPLETED

### 1.1 Update Existing Models
**File**: `schema.prisma` âœ…

#### Enhanced Image Model
```prisma
model Image {
  id          String   @id @default(uuid())
  url         String   // Final GCS URL
  originalUrl String?  // Original image URL (if uploaded)
  description String?  // User-provided or AI-generated description
  fileName    String   // Display name
  mimeType    String   // image/png, image/jpeg, etc.
  isPublic    Boolean  @default(false) // For future sharing features
  userId      String
  user        Users    @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
  updatedAt   DateTime @updatedAt
  
  // Link to edit history
  editHistory ImageEdit[]
}
```

### 1.2 Add New Models

#### TempImage Model
```prisma
model TempImage {
  id        String   @id @default(uuid())
  url       String   // Temporary GCS URL
  fileName  String   
  mimeType  String   
  userId    String
  user      Users    @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  createdAt DateTime @default(now())
  expiresAt DateTime // Auto-cleanup after 24 hours
}
```

#### ImageEdit Model
```prisma  
model ImageEdit {
  id          String   @id @default(uuid())
  imageId     String
  image       Image    @relation(fields: [imageId], references: [id], onDelete: Cascade)
  editType    String   // 'generation', 'region_edit', 'filter', etc.
  prompt      String?  // The prompt used for this edit
  beforeUrl   String?  // Image state before this edit
  afterUrl    String   // Image state after this edit
  userId      String
  user        Users    @relation(fields: [userId], references: [id])
  createdAt   DateTime @default(now())
}
```

#### Update Users Model
```prisma
model Users {
  // ... existing fields ...
  images      Image[]
  tempImages  TempImage[]
  imageEdits  ImageEdit[]
}
```
